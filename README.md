# Pokemon Password Generator

A simple xkcd-style password generator using Pokemon names.
Link to the xkcd strip [here](https://xkcd.com/936/).

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository in any directory
2. Run `python pokemon-password`
3. Select which generations of Pokemon you want, separated by space (ex. 1 2 3)
4. Delete the repo after you find a satisfactory password with `rm pokemon-password`

## Aside

This is my first self-initiated project, so feel free to report any bugs, any wanted features, or anything I should include!
